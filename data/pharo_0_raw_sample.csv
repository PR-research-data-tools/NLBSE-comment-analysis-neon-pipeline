My subclasses wrap concrete data structures for storing the actual children. Bloc elements work with children only in terms of the API that I provide. Hence, I only provide a minimum API needed to work with children, instead of the full collection API.

I allow elements to optimize working with children for different scenarious. For example, an array for storing children optimises for accessing fast accesses at any position. A linked list optimize for fast adding and removing. A rope uses a balanced binary tree to support fast adding, removing and accessing, with the disadvantage of taking more memory.

7,WAComboResponse,"WAComboResponse is a combination of a buffered and a streaming response. By default, WAComboResponse will buffer the entire response to be sent at the end of the request processing cycle. If streaming is desired, the response can be flushed by sending it the #flush message. Flushing a response will sent all previously buffered data using chunked transfer-encoding (which preserves persistent connections). Clients can flush the response as often as they want at appropriate points in their response generation; everything buffered up to that point will be sent. For example, a search results page might use something like:

renderContentOn: aCanvas
	""Render the search page""

	self renderSearchLabelOn: aCanvas.
	aCanvas flush. ""flush before starting search to give immediate feedback""

	self searchResultsDo:[:aResult|
		self renderSearchResultOn: aCanvas.
		aCanvas flush. ""flush after each search result""
	].

After a response has been flushed once, header modifications are no longer possible and will raise a WAIllegalStateException.

An uncommitted response should be handled as usual by the server adapter.","""WAComboResponse is a combination of a buffered and a streaming response.","By default, WAComboResponse will buffer the entire response to be sent at the end of the request processing cycle.

The association value is an object of your choosing, which your code uses to restore that ""page"". 

To add to the path use the method WAPath>>pushSegment: anObject name: 'lulu'. The name: arguement is the association key, the segment: argument is the association value.

The method WAPath>>currentSegment returns object associated with the current ""page"". Your code is not notified when the user clicks on a link in the WAPath object. So when you render a page call WAPath>>currentSegment to get the current object, and generate the page accordingly.

See WAInspector for example use.

WAPath maintains a stack of associations,","one for each ""location"" or ""page"" in the path. The association key is the text that is displayed in the breadcrimb. The association value is an object of your choosing, which your code uses to restore that ""page"".","To add to the path use the method WAPath>>pushSegment: anObject name: 'lulu'. The name: arguement is the association key, the segment: argument is the association value.

The method WAPath>>currentSegment returns object associated with the current ""page"". Your code is not notified when the user clicks on a link in the WAPath object. So when you render a page call WAPath>>currentSegment to get the current object, and generate the page accordingly.",,"Instance Variables:
